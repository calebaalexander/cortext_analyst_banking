- **Interactive exploration**: Drill-down, filtering, and slicing capabilities
- **Scheduled reporting**: Automated delivery of regular reports
- **Complex visualizations**: Advanced charts, graphs, and analytics
- **Operational monitoring**: Real-time tracking of KPIs

**The Power of Integration:**
When you combine both - using the same semantic model - you get the best of both worlds. Business users can ask quick questions with Cortex Analyst, then dive deeper with interactive dashboards, all working from the same trusted data foundation."

---

### Q3: "How do semantic models handle data quality and consistency issues?"

**Response:**
"Semantic models are actually a key solution to data quality and consistency challenges:

**Standardized Definitions:**
- Business metrics are defined once, in one place
- Everyone uses the same calculation logic
- No more conflicting reports or 'multiple versions of the truth'

**Data Quality Controls:**
- Built-in validation rules at the semantic layer
- Automatic handling of null values and edge cases
- Consistent formatting and aggregation methods

**Governance & Auditability:**
- Clear lineage from business metric back to raw data
- Version control for metric definitions
- Approval workflows for changes to business logic

**Example:** Instead of having 10 different definitions of 'customer churn rate' across different departments, you define it once in the semantic model. Whether someone asks Cortex Analyst 'What's our churn rate?' or views it on a dashboard, they get the same, accurate answer.

This is especially critical for financial institutions where regulatory reporting requires precise, auditable calculations."

---

### Q4: "What's the learning curve for business users to adopt Cortex Analyst?"

**Progressive Complexity:**
- Start with simple questions: 'What was our revenue last month?'
- Gradually ask more complex questions: 'Which branches had the highest NPL rates?'
- Users naturally discover more advanced capabilities

**Training Requirements:**
- Most users are productive within 30 minutes
- No formal training classes needed
- Built-in help and examples guide users

**Success Story:** At one regional bank, business analysts went from waiting 2-3 days for IT to run reports to getting answers in seconds. The adoption rate was over 80% within the first month."
