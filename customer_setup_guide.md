## üîç Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Database Creation

```sql
-- Check that the database was created
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'BANKING_AI_DEMO';

-- Use the database
USE DATABASE BANKING_AI_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA BANKING_SCHEMA;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| DATABASE_NAME    | OWNER            | COMMENT          |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| BANKING_AI_DEMO  | YOUR_ROLE_NAME   |                  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

```sql
-- Check all tables were created
SHOW TABLES;

-- You should see 17 tables:
-- customer_dim, account_dim, product_dim, branch_dim, employee_dim,
-- region_dim, industry_dim, risk_tier_dim, transaction_type_dim,
-- loan_type_dim, investment_type_dim, compliance_category_dim,
-- channel_dim, transaction_fact, loan_portfolio_fact,
-- investment_portfolio_fact, compliance_fact
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| TABLE_NAME       | TABLE_TYPE       | COMMENT          |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| CUSTOMER_DIM     | TABLE            |                  |
| ACCOUNT_DIM      | TABLE            |                  |
| PRODUCT_DIM      | TABLE            |                  |
| ...              | ...              | ...              |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

### Step 3: Verify Sample Data

```sql
-- Check sample data was loaded
SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count FROM customer_dim;
SELECT COUNT(*) as account_count FROM account_dim;
SELECT COUNT(*) as transaction_count FROM transaction_fact;
SELECT COUNT(*) as loan_count FROM loan_portfolio_fact;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------------+
| CUSTOMER_COUNT   |
+------------------+
| 8                |
+------------------+

+------------------+
| ACCOUNT_COUNT    |
+------------------+

+---------------------+

+------------------+
| LOAN_COUNT       |
+------------------+
| 6                |
+------------------+
```

### Step 4: Verify Semantic Views

```sql
-- Check semantic views were created
SHOW VIEWS;

-- You should see 4 semantic views:
-- retail_banking_semantic, commercial_banking_semantic,
-- risk_compliance_semantic, wealth_management_semantic
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+---------------------------+------------------+------------------+
| VIEW_NAME                 | OWNER            | COMMENT          |
+---------------------------+------------------+------------------+
| RETAIL_BANKING_SEMANTIC   | YOUR_ROLE_NAME   |                  |
| COMMERCIAL_BANKING_SEMANTIC | YOUR_ROLE_NAME |                  |
| RISK_COMPLIANCE_SEMANTIC  | YOUR_ROLE_NAME   |                  |
| WEALTH_MANAGEMENT_SEMANTIC | YOUR_ROLE_NAME  |                  |
+---------------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

### Step 5: Test Sample Queries

```sql
-- Test a simple query
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    customer_type,
    customer_segment,
    region
FROM customer_dim
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Insufficient privileges" Error

**Problem:** You don't have permission to create databases/warehouses

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Contact your Snowflake administrator to grant these privileges:
GRANT CREATE DATABASE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE_NAME;
GRANT CREATE WAREHOUSE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE_NAME;
GRANT CREATE ROLE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE_NAME;
```

#### Issue 2: "Cortex Analyst not available" Error

**Problem:** Cortex Analyst is not enabled in your Snowflake instance

**Solution:**
- Contact your Snowflake administrator
- Verify your Snowflake edition supports Cortex Analyst
- Ensure Cortex Analyst is enabled for your account

#### Issue 3: "Table already exists" Error

**Problem:** Tables from a previous setup attempt still exist

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Drop existing database and recreate
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS BANKING_AI_DEMO;
-- Then re-run the setup script
```

#### Issue 4: "Warehouse not found" Error

**Problem:** Warehouse was not created or is suspended

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check warehouse status
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'Banking_Intelligence_demo_wh';

-- Resume warehouse if suspended
ALTER WAREHOUSE Banking_Intelligence_demo_wh RESUME;
```

#### Issue 5: "Role not found" Error

**Problem:** Role was not created or you don't have access

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if role exists
SHOW ROLES LIKE 'BANKING_Intelligence_Demo';

-- Grant role to your user if needed
GRANT ROLE BANKING_Intelligence_Demo TO USER YOUR_USERNAME;
```

### Performance Optimization

If queries are running slowly:

```sql
-- Increase warehouse size temporarily
ALTER WAREHOUSE Banking_Intelligence_demo_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL';

-- After demo, return to XSMALL
ALTER WAREHOUSE Banking_Intelligence_demo_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL';
```

   - Have these questions ready to test during the demo:
     - "What was our total deposit growth last quarter by branch?"
     - "Show me the number of new checking accounts opened this year"
     - "What is our non-performing loan rate by region?"

3. **Familiarize Yourself with the Data**
   ```sql
   -- Explore the data structure
   DESCRIBE TABLE customer_dim;
   DESCRIBE TABLE transaction_fact;
   DESCRIBE TABLE loan_portfolio_fact;
   ```

### During the Presentation

1. **Follow Along with Queries**
   - Execute the same queries as demonstrated
   - Compare your results with the presenter's results
   - Note any differences or questions

   - Try asking questions in natural language
   - Experiment with different banking scenarios
   - Explore the semantic views

3. **Take Notes**
   - Document any issues or questions
   - Note interesting features or capabilities
   - Record potential use cases for your organization

### After the Presentation

1. **Clean Up (Optional)**
   ```sql
   -- If you want to remove the demo environment
   DROP DATABASE BANKING_AI_DEMO;
   DROP WAREHOUSE Banking_Intelligence_demo_wh;
   DROP ROLE BANKING_Intelligence_Demo;
   ```

2. **Document Learnings**
